**WordPress YouTube and Buzzsprout Integration**

**Plugin Overview**

The "Mureed Sultan" plugin is a WordPress plugin that integrates with the YouTube API and Buzzsprout API to fetch and push YouTube videos and Buzzsprout podcasts to your WordPress website. It provides a settings page where users can enter their API keys and configure various options for fetching and pushing videos and podcasts.


**Plugin Functionality**

The Mureed Sultan plugin adds a menu item under the "Settings" section in the WordPress admin panel. The menu item allows users with sufficient permissions to access the Mureed Sultan Plugin settings page.


**Settings Page**

The settings page provides a form where users can configure the plugin settings. The form includes the following fields:


**YouTube API Key:** To obtain the API key required for the plugin, follow these steps:

-Go to the Google Developers Console (console.developers.google.com) and sign in with their Google account.

-Create a new project by clicking on the "Select a project" dropdown at the top of the page and selecting "New Project." Enter a name for the project and click on the "Create" button.

-Once the project is created, select it from the "Select a project" dropdown.

-Enable the YouTube Data API by clicking on the "Enable APIs and Services" button.

-In the search bar, type "YouTube Data API" and select it from the results.

-Click on the "Enable" button to enable the API for your project.

-On the left sidebar, click on "Credentials" to create a new API key.

-Click on the "Create credentials" button and select "API key" from the dropdown.

-A popup window will appear showing your API key. Copy the API key and keep it secure.

-Paste the API key into the "YouTube API Key" field on the plugin's settings page.

**YouTube Channel ID:**  The YouTube Channel ID is a unique identifier assigned to a specific YouTube channel. It is used to identify and access the content associated with that channel. 

To obtain the YouTube Channel ID, the user needs to visit the YouTube channel they want to fetch videos from. They can find the Channel ID by either inspecting the source code of the YouTube channel page or by following certain steps such as:

-Open the YouTube channel in a web browser.

-Click on the "About" section of the channel.

-In the URL of the browser, locate the string of characters after "channel/".

-That string of characters is the YouTube Channel ID.

**Select Playlist:** After providing the API Key and YouTube Channel ID in the plugin's settings page, the "Select Playlist" dropdown will dynamically appear, allowing users to choose a playlist from the specified YouTube channel.

**Post Category:** A dropdown to select the category for the WordPress posts created from the fetched videos.

**Time Format (HH:MM):** The format for specifying the time to schedule the event for updating the database.

**Fetch Playlists Button:** A button to fetch the playlists from the YouTube channel.

**Push Videos Button:** A button to push the fetched videos to WordPress posts.


Additionally, the settings page includes fields for the Buzzsprout integration:


**Buzzsprout ID:** The ID of the Buzzsprout podcast.

**Buzzsprout API Key:** The API key required to access the Buzzsprout API.

**Podcast Category:** A dropdown to select the category for the WordPress posts created from the pushed podcasts.

**Number of Podcasts:** The number of podcasts to fetch or push.

**Fetch Podcasts Button:** A button to fetch the podcasts from the Buzzsprout API.

**Push Podcasts Button:** A button to push the fetched podcasts to WordPress posts.


**AJAX Requests**

AJAX requests in the plugin are used to communicate with the server and external APIs. They allow the plugin to fetch playlists from YouTube and push videos to WordPress without refreshing the page.

**Fetch Playlists:** When the user clicks the "Fetch Playlists" button, an AJAX request fetches the playlists from the YouTube API based on the provided API Key and YouTube Channel ID. The response updates the "Select Playlist" dropdown.

**Push Videos:** Similarly, when the user clicks the "Push Videos" button, another AJAX request sends the selected playlist ID to the server, which fetches the videos and performs necessary actions, such as creating WordPress posts. 

**Fetch Podcasts:** When the "Fetch Podcasts" button is clicked, an AJAX request is sent to the Buzzsprout API to fetch the specified number of podcasts. The fetched podcasts' details are then used to create WordPress posts.

**Push Podcasts:** When the "Push Podcasts" button is clicked, an AJAX request is sent for each fetched podcast to create a WordPress post with the podcast details, such as title, description, and audio URL.
